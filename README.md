# Breakout

## About
This is my recreation of the 1976 Atari game Breakout in C++. For this project i also utilised my own custom math library which you can find [linked here.](https://github.com/JoeTingle/Math-Library) This was completed during my time at university so i used there custom framework to build upon, the majority of my own code are found in the following files :
- Ball.cpp + .h
- Brick.cpp + .h
- Player.cpp + .h
- Globals.h
- Main.cpp

## How To Run
In the current version (currently developing) the game must be run and compiled from the IDE, Visual Studio 2019 in my case, and will not run from the executable itself. So to run it open the solution file and run from the default configuration (Debug x64).
Now you should be able to see the game as in the image below and play by moving the mouse cursor to bounce to ball off the walls.
